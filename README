terminal-based block game (which i invented btw), where falling patterns of
blocks are able to be moved and/or rotated by the player until hitting the 
floor or another block, where they are stopped in place (and a new block starts 
falling). if a full horizontal line is completed, points are awarded to the 
player and the line is wiped, with all blocks above the line falling to their 
next stopping point. at certain point thresholds, the game speed is increased.

the game ends when any block reaches the ceiling of the screen, at which point
the player is prompted to enter their initials, which are then logged along
with their score into the highscore file.

the game launches to a menu program (also returns here when game is lost or
quit out of), from which the game can be launched, game settings can be changed 
(writes to conf.h), the system highscores can be viewed, or new blocks can be
defined or enabled/disabled (blocks are saved to blocks.h to be used in game)

takes no input parameters.

usage:
  ./teetris

  l / right arrow	- 	move block right
